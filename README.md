# Peixoto_Sweet_Corn_hybrid_prediction

This is a repository with the scripts of the paper: Utilizing Genomic Prediction to Boost Hybrid Performance in a Sweet Corn Breeding Program (Peixoto et al.).

# Still working on it

### Specifications

The three folders are related to the pipeline of hybrid prediction for a sweet corn dataset. It combines the phenotypic data, genotypic data, scripts for running all analyses and cross-validations (CV), and scripts for plotting. We describe each one in the next section.

### Contents

**1.Datasets**: Contains the phenotypic and the genotypic datasets for running the analyses.


**2.Scripts**: This folder has the scripts for all three different cross-validation schemes used:

i. **CV1**: untested hybrids in tested environments.  
ii. **CV0**: tested hybrids in untested environments.  
ii. **CV00**: untested hybrids in untested environments.  


**3.Plot**: This folder contains a script to plot the graphs as an outcome of the analyses.
